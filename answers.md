Activity 7:

    1. Deck, cards, table, an ice cold glass of lemonaid, a recliner
    
    2.Shuffle all the cards, deal nine cards onto table. I would check to see if there are any cards I can remove. If there is, I pick what to remove and draw the neccessary cards to replace them. I continue untill there are zero cards or there are no more moves.

    3.Yes I think it includes all methods neccessary to play.

    4.
        a. In the constructor and new game function.
        b. isLegal() and anotherPlayIsPossibe()
        c. 0,1,3,6,7
        d. for(int k = 0; i < cIndexes.length; i++){
                System.out.println(cards[cIndexes.get(k)].toString());
            }
        e. isLegal() because it needs to know what cards are left, where they are and if the selected card is null or not.
