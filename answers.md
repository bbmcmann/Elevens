4/4/2020: Deleted old git repo because I was unable to get to a6. Forked new repo and I am now in a6.
Will begin working on 6-9 from this repo. 1-5 was in old repo.
Questions:
A6:

    1. 6 and 5, 6 and other 5
    2. Yes if there are only 3 cards left then they must be KJQ. The only way to remove that type of card is by eliminatiing 3 at once. Every other type of elimination happens in pairs, so 3 left at the end can only happen if one KJQ triple is unaccounted for.
    3.No theres zero strategy. Its all luck what you draw because each card only has one other number it can add with to get 11. So it doesnt matter when you remoe a certain card.
