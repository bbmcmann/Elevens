Activity a8

    1. All the games have very basic names. They all require dealing x ammount of cards, then systematically removing and replacing cardss in differnt ways untill there are no mre ways t remove cards or there are no cards left.

    2. They are intitialized in teh constructor with the super() mechanic. This uses the constructor from the parent class but uses the values passed into teh ElevensBoard Constructur when creating the object.

    3. isLegal() and anotherPlayIsPossible() are both abstract, and should be all that is needed to differentiate the Elevens Thrirteens and Tens games.
